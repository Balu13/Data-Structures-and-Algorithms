Lesson 3 Assignment of Algorithmic Toolbox on Coursera

Problem

Given a sequence of non-negative integers a(0),…,a(n−1), find the maximum pairwise product, that is, the largest integer that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence (or, more formally, max(a(i)*a(j)) where 0≤i≠j≤n−1). Different elements here mean a(i) and a(j) with i≠j (it can be the case that a(i)=a(j)).

Input format

The first line of the input contains an integer n. The next line contains n non-negative integers a0,…,an−1 (separated by spaces).

Constraints

2≤n≤2⋅10^5; 0≤a(0),…,a(n−1)≤10^5.

Output format

Output a single number — the maximum pairwise product.
